# Data Collector Application
This application levearges a flask application to host a front end website that collects user details on height in cm and stores the information in a Postgres database. The application analyzes the average height of participants in the database and emails a response with the results.

The goal of this application is to get more familiar with testing email functionality within an application using Postgres, hosting it on AWS using different services for POC testing and eventually dockerizing it. This practice will assist in capturing the steps when taking a legacy application, hosting it on AWS using EC2, PaaS services, AWS container services etc...
